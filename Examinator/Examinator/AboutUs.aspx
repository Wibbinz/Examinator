    <div class="aboutUs">
        <p>Why is the sky blue? Where do you get magic beans? What makes shiny things shiny?<br />
            These questions and more have long plagued mankind, particularly those prototypes that engage in the lofty, yet
            mind-boggling act of reproduction. In response, the noble institution of Sad Panda Inc. has put into effect a new
            directive with the objective of advancing the cummulative mental capacity of prototypes and descendants alike.

        <p>All administrator-approved questions in the Examinator have been personally endorsed by the venerated Vulcan 
            (see signature below), who made use of the highly-recommended Examinator application as part of his rehabilitation
            program after his katra was recovered from Dr. McCoy and restored to physical form.
